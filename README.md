🛡️ Phishing Copilot & Social Engineering Trainer - made by me and my friend [David](https://github.com/davidd234) at a hackathon

A comprehensive cybersecurity suite designed to assess user vulnerability via simulation and protect their inbox using an AI-powered monitoring agent.

📂 Project Overview

This solution consists of three integrated components:

The "Donna" Simulator (Assessment): A social engineering training tool where an AI persona ("Donna from HR") attempts to extract sensitive information from the user. It calculates a Risk Score (0-100) based on how much information the user reveals.

Phishing Copilot Agent (Protection): A background service that monitors an IMAP inbox 24/7. It analyzes incoming emails using GPT-4o, detects phishing attempts, moves them to Spam, and creates a log. It adjusts its sensitivity based on the user's Risk Score.

Live Dashboard (Monitoring): A Flask-based web interface to visualize blocked threats, view logs, and check system status in real-time.

🚀 Features

🎭 Social Engineering Simulator (risk_score_donna.py)

Interactive Chat: Real-time conversation with an AI attacker using Tkinter.

Dynamic Tactic: The AI adjusts its persuasion techniques (friendly, urgent, authoritative).

TrustMeter: A secondary AI model analyzes the chat to calculate a final vulnerability score.

Educational Feedback: Provides examples of weak passwords based on revealed data at the end.

📡 Phishing Copilot Agent (phishing_copilot_agent.py)

Adaptive Security: Uses the score from the Simulator to set the blocking threshold (High Risk User = Stricter Filtering).

Auto-Remediation: Automatically moves detected phishing emails to the Spam folder.

Weekly Reports: Sends a summary email every 7 days with statistics.

Heartbeat System: Updates a status file to let the dashboard know the service is alive.

📊 Web Dashboard (app.py)

Live Monitoring: Shows total threats blocked and weekly stats.

System Health: Displays "System Active" or "Inactive" based on agent heartbeat.

Detailed Logs: View subject lines, risk scores, and AI explanations for every blocked email.

Dark Mode UI: Built with Tailwind CSS.

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-copilot.git](https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-copilot.git)
cd phishing-copilot


2. Install Dependencies

pip install openai flask python-dotenv tk


3. Environment Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your credentials:

# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
IMAP_PASS="your-gmail-app-password"


Note: For Gmail, IMAP_PASS is your App Password, not your login password.

🖥️ Usage Guide

Step 1: Run the Assessment (Optional)

Run the simulator to generate your baseline risk score. This creates phishing_users.json.

python risk_score_donna.py


Step 2: Start the Protection Agent

This script must run in the background to monitor emails.

python phishing_copilot_agent.py


Output: "📡 Phishing Copilot started..."

Step 3: Launch the Dashboard

Open a new terminal window and run the web server.

python app.py
